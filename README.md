📕Best way to take notes📕

Thanks to the use of the AssemblyAI API, the microphone will listen for you and in the right part of the screen you will see the transcription of your lessons.

In the until then, you can take only the most important notes or add appendices to the right side of the screen.

As you write, you will notice that on the right side of the screen (where the transcript) some sentences will turn red, artificial intelligence has found the continuation of the sentence you are writing! Press the ALT (Win) / OPTION (MacOS) key twice to accept the suggestion and make the sentence complete automatically.
